              with a background in marketing and eCommerce sales. Recently
              earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from
              Northwestern University with a focus on developing skills in
              JavaScript, CSS, React.js, Node.js, MongDB, and responsive web
              design. I strive to maintain a high work ethic, positive attitude,
              and provide the most value in any relationship. With each new
              opportunity, my willingness to evolve and grow has allowed me to
              advance in my career. With these principles and my love for
              problem solving, I hope to work with talented individuals who are
              hungry to develop technologies that better the lives of our
              customers and peers. Iâ€™m also lucky to have had fantastic mentors
              along the way and I look forward to being a resource to others in
              my field as I progress through my career.
